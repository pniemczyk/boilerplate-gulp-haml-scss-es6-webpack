Minimal setup for building modular javascript apps with ES6, HAML and SASS
- HAML compilation to HTML
- ES6 compilation to JS
- SASS compilation to CSS
- Separate build directory for easy deployments
- Uglify to obscure and minify javascript 
- Webpack to bundle modules
- Gulp watch for incremental builds (compiling on save)
- Growl notifications
